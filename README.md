# MOVIEMATCH

## Motivation: 1
I maintain IMDB watchlist and have repeatedly check yts if movies are available or not, which is mundane activity and time-consuming, yeah I am a bit lazy to do that.
so I am creating this library which does that and helps me find the match.

## Motivation: 2
getting my hands dirty at *elixir-lang*

## Installation
If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `moviematch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:moviematch, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/moviematch](https://hexdocs.pm/moviematch).
